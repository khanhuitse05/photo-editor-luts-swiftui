# Photo editor with SwiftUI and muukii/Pixel

- CoreImage
- CoreGraphics
- My app with this source code in store: [AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1525852224)

- [Pixel Engine](https://github.com/muukii/Pixel)
	- as Muukii's repository. He use the old user interface - Storyboard. So I cloned his "Pixel Engine" and upgrade UI to swiftUI
- User interface: SwiftUI
